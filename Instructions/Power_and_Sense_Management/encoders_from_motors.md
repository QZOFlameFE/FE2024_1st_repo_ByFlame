Encoders are used for calculating the distance that robot moved. In programm they are used to know if the robot is in finish zone. They play significant role in driving and the steering control. PID regulator works by the encoder of steering. Also before the start robot fixes it steering for making perfect initial position as it is important for odometry.
</br>
The odometry is based on encoders in combine with gyro sensor. Detailed information is in the <a href="https://github.com/QZOFlameFE/FE2024_1st_repo_ByFlame/blob/main/Instructions/Power_and_Sense_Management/odometry.md">odometry</a> section.
