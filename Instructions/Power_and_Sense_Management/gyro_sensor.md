We use gyro sensor to save robot's initial(starting) position and count its deviation in degrees. In programm we use gyro sensor for tracing the robot position, and control the drive of the robot like turns and correction of the straight ride by PD and PID regulators. Especially it place specific role in steering control that is performed by PID regulator. The PD regulator traces robot's position in angles in comparison with robot's initial (starting) position.

Gyro sensor have a significant role in odometry, especially in math constructions when the angles are needed. Detailed information is in the <a href="https://github.com/QZOFlameFE/FE2024_1st_repo_ByFlame/blob/main/Instructions/Power_and_Sense_Management/odometry.md">odometry</a> section.
